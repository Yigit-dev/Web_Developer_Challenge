            a better service and better value than any of our competitors. We

            I Want to sell but I was expecting higher valuations. What are the
            options?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="question-answer">
            Valuations are subjective, they’re not an exact science, and so it
            is natural that opinions will differ. When valuing, our job is to
            give you an evidence-based estimate of the valuation range but if
            you want your property marketed at above, or below, our valuation
            range you just need to tell us - you’re the boss!
